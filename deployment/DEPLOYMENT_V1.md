## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 5 with Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm) 64-bit
- USB webcam connected
- Internet connection
- Railway or cloud-hosted API server
- Git repository access

---

## Quick Installation

### 1. Download and run installation script

```bash
# On your Raspberry Pi
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/atxapple/visant.git
cd visant
sudo chmod +x deployment/install_device.sh

# Option 1: Fresh install with Tailscale (recommended)
sudo deployment/install_device.sh --tailscale-key tskey-auth-xxxxx

# Option 2: Fresh install without Tailscale (can add later)
sudo deployment/install_device.sh

# Option 3: Reinstall, skip Tailscale (safe for remote reinstalls)
sudo deployment/install_device.sh --skip-tailscale

# Option 4: Reinstall, force Tailscale reconfiguration
sudo deployment/install_device.sh --install-tailscale
```

**Installation Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--tailscale-key KEY` | Install and connect Tailscale with auth key |
| `--skip-tailscale` | Skip Tailscale (preserves existing connection) |
| `--install-tailscale` | Force Tailscale reconfiguration |

**Note:** Tailscale provides secure remote SSH/VNC access. The installer intelligently detects existing Tailscale connections and prompts before making changes. Generate an auth key at https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys

### 2. Configure the device

Edit the environment file with your settings:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/visant/.env.device
```

**Required configuration:**
```bash
# Your Railway or cloud API URL
API_URL=https://app.visant.ai

# Unique device identifier
DEVICE_ID=floor-01-cam

# Camera device (usually 0 for first USB camera)
CAMERA_SOURCE=0
```

### 3. Test the service

```bash
# Start the service
sudo systemctl start visant-device-v2

# Watch the logs
sudo journalctl -u visant-device-v2 -f

# You should see:
# [device] Entering scheduled capture mode...
# [device] Received new config: {...}
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop watching logs.

### 4. Enable auto-start

```bash
# The service is already enabled by install script
# Verify it's enabled:
sudo systemctl is-enabled visant-device-v2

# Check status
sudo systemctl status visant-device-v2
```

### 5. Verify update timer

```bash
# Check that the update timer is scheduled
sudo systemctl list-timers visant-update

# You should see it scheduled for next trigger (02:00 daily or on next boot)
```

### 6. Verify deployment

```bash
# Run automated verification
sudo deployment/verify_deployment.sh
```

This will check all critical components and report any issues.

### 7. Reboot and verify

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, wait 30 seconds then check:

```bash
# Should show "active (running)"
sudo systemctl status visant-device-v2

# Should show recent logs
sudo journalctl -u visant-device-v2 --since "5 minutes ago"
```

## Fleet Deployment

### Option 1: Individual Installation

For 1-5 devices, follow the Quick Installation steps above for each device.

### Option 2: Clone Golden Image (Recommended for 5+ devices)

For deploying many devices, it's much faster to:
1. Set up one perfect "golden" device
2. Create an SD card image
3. Clone the image to multiple SD cards
4. Customize each clone with unique device ID

**See detailed instructions:** [CLONING.md](CLONING.md)

**Quick overview:**

```bash
# One-time: Create golden image
sudo deployment/install_device.sh
sudo deployment/prepare_for_clone.sh
# Then create SD card image on your computer

# Per device: Clone and customize
# 1. Write image to SD card
# 2. Boot and customize:
ssh mok@raspberrypi.local
sudo deployment/customize_clone.sh
```

This approach saves hours when deploying 10+ devices!

## Additional Services

### Remote Access (Tailscale)

Tailscale is **automatically installed** during device setup. If you didn't provide an auth key during installation, connect now:

**See detailed instructions:** [TAILSCALE.md](TAILSCALE.md)

```bash
# Connect to Tailscale (if not done during installation)
sudo deployment/install_tailscale.sh --auth-key YOUR_KEY
```

### WiFi Configuration

#### Option 1: Comitup (Recommended for Field Deployment)

Zero-touch WiFi setup via web interface - no SSH needed!

**See detailed instructions:** [COMITUP.md](COMITUP.md)

```bash
# Install Comitup
sudo deployment/install_comitup.sh

# Usage (on-site):
# 1. Connect phone to 'visant-XXXX' WiFi (no password)
# 2. Open browser to http://10.41.0.1
# 3. Select and configure customer WiFi
```

#### Option 2: WiFi Script (For Remote Management)

Easy WiFi setup for technicians with SSH access:

**See detailed instructions:** [WIFI.md](WIFI.md)

```bash
# Add WiFi network
~/addwifi.sh "Network-Name" "password" [priority]

# List saved networks
~/addwifi.sh --list
```

sudo reboot
```

### Camera not found

```bash
# List video devices
v4l2-ctl --list-devices

# Test camera with v4l2
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --all

# If camera is /dev/video1, edit .env.device:
sudo nano /opt/visant/.env.device
# Change: CAMERA_SOURCE=1
sudo systemctl restart visant-device-v2
```

### Network connection fails

```bash
# Check if API URL is reachable
curl -I https://app.visant.ai

# Check DNS resolution
nslookup app.visant.ai

# Check network status
ip addr
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```

### Updates not happening

```bash
# Check timer status
sudo systemctl status visant-update.timer

# Check if timer is enabled
sudo systemctl is-enabled visant-update.timer

# If not enabled:
sudo systemctl enable visant-update.timer

# Check last run
sudo journalctl -u visant-update.service -n 50

# Manually test update
sudo /opt/visant/deployment/update_device.sh
```

### High CPU or memory usage

```bash
# Check resource usage
htop
# or
top

# View service resource limits
systemctl show visant-device-v2 | grep -i memory
systemctl show visant-device-v2 | grep -i cpu

# Adjust limits in service file if needed
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/visant-device-v2.service
# Modify MemoryMax= and CPUQuota= values
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart visant-device-v2
```

### Disk space issues

```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h

# Check debug captures size (if enabled)
du -sh /opt/visant/debug_captures

# Clean old debug captures (older than 7 days)
find /opt/visant/debug_captures -type f -mtime +7 -delete
```

**Note:** Debug frame saving is **disabled by default** (`SAVE_FRAMES_DIR=` is blank). Enable only for troubleshooting:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/visant/.env.device
# Set: SAVE_FRAMES_DIR=/opt/visant/debug_captures
sudo systemctl restart visant-device-v2
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Update Policy

Visant uses a **hybrid update strategy** to ensure devices always run the latest code:

#### How It Works

The system uses TWO independent update mechanisms that work together:

**ExecStartPre in Service File:**
```ini
[Service]
ExecStartPre=+/opt/visant/deployment/pre-start-update.sh
```
The `+` prefix runs the script with elevated privileges. This runs BEFORE the main service starts, on every service start attempt.

**Timer-Based Scheduled Updates:**
```ini
[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 02:00:00
Persistent=true
```
The timer triggers daily updates for long-running devices. When triggered, it updates code and restarts the service (which then runs ExecStartPre again).

#### Mechanism 1: Pre-Start Updates (Boot/Restart)
- Runs **before** the service starts (via `ExecStartPre` in systemd)
- Automatically updates code and dependencies on:
  - Device boot
  - Manual service restart (`systemctl restart visant-device-v2`)
  - Crash recovery (service auto-restart)
- **Fail-safe**: Service won't start if update fails (prevents running outdated code)
- Script location: `/opt/visant/deployment/pre-start-update.sh`

#### Mechanism 2: Scheduled Updates (Long-Running Devices)
- Runs daily at **2:00 AM** (configurable)
- Updates code, then restarts the service
- Ensures devices that run continuously for days/weeks stay updated
- Includes random 0-5 minute delay to avoid simultaneous updates across devices
- If device is offline at 2 AM, runs on next boot (via `Persistent=true`)

#### Update Scenarios

**Scenario A: Device boots at 8 AM**
1. Pre-start update runs → pulls latest code
2. Service starts with updated code
3. Continues running until next restart or 2 AM update

**Scenario B: Device runs continuously for 3 days**
1. Day 1, 2 AM: Scheduled update → restart → pre-start update → latest code
2. Day 2, 2 AM: Scheduled update → restart → pre-start update → latest code
3. Day 3, 2 AM: Scheduled update → restart → pre-start update → latest code

**Scenario C: Device offline at 2 AM, boots at 9 AM**
1. Pre-start update runs → pulls latest code
2. Service starts with updated code
3. (Scheduled update will run next day at 2 AM)

#### Monitoring Updates

Check update logs:

```bash
# Pre-start update logs (part of service logs)
journalctl -u visant-device-v2 -n 50

# Scheduled update logs
journalctl -u visant-update -n 50
sudo tail -f /var/log/visant-update.log
```

### Log Rotation

Logs are automatically managed by systemd's journald. To check space:

```bash
# Check journal size
journalctl --disk-usage

# Clean logs older than 7 days
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
```

### Debug Capture Cleanup

Add a cron job to clean old captures:

```bash
# Edit crontab
sudo crontab -e

# Add line to clean files older than 7 days at 3 AM daily
0 3 * * * find /opt/visant/debug_captures -type f -mtime +7 -delete
```

### Health Monitoring

Create a simple health check script:

```bash
sudo nano /opt/visant/health_check.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple health check
if systemctl is-active --quiet visant-device-v2; then
    echo "OK: Service is running"
    exit 0
else
    echo "ERROR: Service is not running"
    exit 1
fi
```

```bash
sudo chmod +x /opt/visant/health_check.sh
```

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Change Scheduled Update Time

To change the daily scheduled update time from 2:00 AM:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/visant-update.timer
# Modify OnCalendar= line (e.g., OnCalendar=*-*-* 04:00:00 for 4 AM)
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart visant-update.timer
```

**Note**: This only affects the scheduled daily update. Pre-start updates (on boot/restart) will still run automatically.

### Multiple Devices

To run multiple camera devices on one Pi:

1. Create separate service files (visant-device-v2-1.service, visant-device-v2-2.service)
2. Create separate .env files (.env.device-1, .env.device-2)
3. Use different DEVICE_ID and CAMERA_SOURCE for each

---

## Uninstallation

Visant includes a comprehensive uninstall script that safely removes all components while preserving Tailscale for continued remote access.

### Quick Uninstall

**Recommended: Keep system packages**

```bash
sudo deployment/uninstall.sh --keep-packages
```

This removes all Visant components but preserves system libraries that may be used by other applications.

**Complete removal (including packages):**

```bash
sudo deployment/uninstall.sh
```

**Non-interactive (for automation):**

```bash
sudo deployment/uninstall.sh --keep-packages --yes
```

### What Gets Removed

- ✗ Visant application (`/opt/visant`)
- ✗ Systemd services and timers
- ✗ Comitup WiFi hotspot system
- ✗ Helper scripts (addwifi.sh)
- ✗ Logs and temporary files
- ✗ System packages (optional)

### What Gets Preserved

- ✅ **Tailscale** - Remote access maintained
- ✅ SSH access remains intact
- ✅ System remains accessible

### Safe Remote Reinstallation

After uninstalling, you can reinstall remotely without losing connection:

```bash
# Uninstall (Tailscale keeps running)
sudo deployment/uninstall.sh --keep-packages

# Reinstall without disrupting Tailscale
sudo deployment/install_device.sh --skip-tailscale
```
